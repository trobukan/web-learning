## What's Memoization

it's a specific optimization technique in computer science, especially within dynamic programming, where
the results of expensive function calls are stored (cached) to avoid redundant computations.

#### example

In a recursive Fibonnaci sequence calculation, memoization would store 
the results of fib(2), fib(3), etc., so they don't need to be recalculated each time they're needed.
