    <!-- I'm gonna learn HTML semantic structural elements, for example
     <main>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <nav> and <footer>, and how to use them correctly.
    
    Also the need to use semantic elements in appropiate places, rather than just using <div> elements wherever a block-level container is required, and the benefits of this.-->
