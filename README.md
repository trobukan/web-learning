This repository is a collection of my studies of web development sudies based mainly on content from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/). All notes are written and organized using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
## 📕 Why am I doing it?
I'm studying web development with the goal of building a solid foundation in **HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT**, while also tracking my progress.
